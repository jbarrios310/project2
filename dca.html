	 <h1> Disney California Adventures is not as extordinary as Disneyland.
	  DCA had less rides for vistors to ride and to enjoy. They dont have a 
	  caslte so you can't meet princesses. There is alos no early admission and
	  they open the theme park at 8:ooam and close it early at 10:00pm. During 
	  holidays they only have minimal of decorations, it doesnt even feel festive.
	  Also, DCA has more of a teen feeling to it, other than a more different ages
	  feel. So everyone is welcomed.
